## Introduction

Cats,cats and cats again... Try the application, where you can look at cats, vote for cats and create list of your favourite cats. Let`s meow.

In this app I used next technologies:

- NextJS 13 with Server Side Rendering as a fullstack framework
- Typescript
- Server Actions for requests to Grafbase
- Zustand as a global storage for more effective managing data
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- There are dark and light mode in application, initial mode depends on chosen color-scheme of your PC
